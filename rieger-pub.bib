 abstract = {States and traits are important concepts in psychological research. They can be operationalized (a) by using measures that employ different time frames and (b) by applying statistical models that decompose the variance. However, the effects of using variations in states and traits by applying measurement and modeling approaches have yet to be merged and studied systematically. The present study addressed this topic by revisiting an intensively studied research question, namely: What is the longitudinal relation between self-esteem and depressive symptoms? To do so, we created state and trait versions of questionnaires by systematically changing the time frame ({\textquotedbl}during the last 2 weeks{\textquotedbl} vs. {\textquotedbl}in general{\textquotedbl}) that was used to measure self-esteem and depressive symptoms and in addition, by using state-trait statistical models. We conducted an exploratory study (N = 683) and a confirmatory replication study (N = 1,087) with samples of university students, designed as a 2 $\times$ 2 longitudinal experiment with 4 time points spanning 1 semester. Our results indicated that first, consistently across the 2 studies, trait time frames revealed higher proportions of trait variance than state time frames. Second, across the 2 studies, the well-researched vulnerability effect, which postulates that low self-esteem predicts depressive symptoms, only held when trait time frames for self-esteem were applied and traditional cross-lagged models were used. Third, when controlling for stable trait differences, cross-lagged results were least consistent when trait time frames were used, which highlighted the interdependency involved in measuring and modeling states and traits.

 abstract = {According to the social-investment principle, entering new environments is associated with new social roles that influence people's behaviors. In this study, we examined whether young adults' personality development is differentially related to their choice of either an academic or a vocational pathway (i.e., entering an academic-track school or beginning vocational training). The personality constructs of interest were Big Five personality traits and vocational-interest orientations. We used a longitudinal study design and propensity-score matching to create comparable groups before they entered one of the pathways and then tested the differences between these groups 6 years later. We expected the vocational pathway to reinforce more mature behavior and curtail investigative interest. Results indicated that choosing the vocational compared with the academic pathway was associated with higher conscientiousness and less interest in investigative, social, and enterprising activities.},

 abstract = {The present study is a close replication of the work of Orth, Robins, and Roberts (2008). Orth et al. (2008) tested three theoretical models of the relation between self-esteem and depression-the vulnerability model, the scar model, and the common factor model-using longitudinal, cross-lagged panel designs. The authors concluded that depression and self-esteem were not the same construct (contrary to the common-factor model), and furthermore, the results were clearly in line with the vulnerability model and not with the scar model (low self-esteem predicts subsequent levels of depression and not vice versa). In addition, the results held for both men and women. To conduct a very close replication of the work of Orth et al. (2008), we used data from another large longitudinal study (N = 2,512), which is highly similar in study design and that contains the same measures (self-esteem and depression). The present study replicated the results of the Orth et al. (2008) study in a notable manner, in regard to the comparability of the coefficients, and therefore, corroborates the vulnerability model (and not the scar- or the common-factor model).

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

In the present research, we examined the effect of getting a new teacher on consistency in students' personality measures, including trait and social cognitive constructs.

METHOD

To test the effect of this kind of situational transition, we analyzed two large longitudinal samples (N~=~5,628; N~=~2,458) with quasi-experimental study designs. We used two consistency measures (i.e., rank-order clations and changes in variance over time) to compare students who got a new teacher with students who kept the same teacher.

RESULTS

Multiple-group latent variable analyses showed no differences in the rank-order correlations for the math-related social cognitive constructs of interest, effort, self-concept, self-regulation, anxiety, and the Big Five personality traits. Significantly lower rank-order correlations were found for some of the German- and English-related social cognitive constructs (i.e., effort measures) for the group of students who got a new teacher. Regarding the changes in variance (over time), we found no systematic differences between groups in both studies.

CONCLUSIONS

We found partial support for the idea that social cognitive variables are more susceptible to environmental changes (i.e., getting a new teacher) than the Big Five personality traits are.},

 abstract = {Vocational interests are important aspects of personality that reflect individual differences in motives, goals, and personal strivings. It is therefore plausible that these characteristics have an impact on individuals' lives not only in terms of vocational outcomes, but also beyond the vocational domain. Yet the effects of vocational interests on various life outcomes have rarely been investigated. Using Holland's RIASEC taxonomy (Holland, 1997), which groups vocational interests into 6 broad domains, the present study examined whether vocational interests are significant predictors of life outcomes that show incremental validity over and above the Big Five personality traits. For this purpose, a cohort of German high school students (N = 3,023) was tracked over a period of 10 years after graduating from school. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the predictive validity of RIASEC interests and Big Five personality traits. Nine outcomes from the domains of work, relationships, and health were investigated. The results indicate that vocational interests are important predictors of life outcomes that show incremental validity over the Big Five personality traits. Vocational interests were significant predictors of 7 of the 9 investigated outcomes: full-time employment, gross income, unemployment, being married, having children, never having had a relationship, and perceived health status. For work and relationship outcomes, vocational interests were even stronger predictors than the Big Five personality traits. For health-related outcomes, the results favored the personality traits. Effects were similar across gender for all outcomes-except 2 relationship outcomes. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{Stoll2020,
 abstract = {Vocational interests shape major life decisions and predict major life outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand how vocational interests develop in young adulthood, a time when young people begin to make their own life decisions. In the present study, we investigated stability and change in vocational interests across a time span of 10 years, including the transition from high school to postsecondary education and the transition into the labor market. Using a large data set comprised of 3,023 German young adults, we provide descriptive information about the longitudinal development of vocational interests across 6 equally spaced time points. We investigated 5 different indicators of stability and change: rank-order stabilities, mean-level changes, changes in variance, profile stabilities, and profile differentiation, as well as gender differences in these indicators. We found high stabilities for the interest scales and interest profiles that increased even more across the period of 10 years. Substantial changes in mean levels occurred primarily in the context of the transition from high school to university, to vocational training, or into the labor market. As expected, there were gender differences in the mean levels, but the developmental patterns in the trajectories of vocational interests were very similar for men and women. Overall, our findings indicate that longitudinal studies with multiple time points are needed to extend knowledge about interest development. In addition, our findings demonstrate that considering normative social transitions may be key to better understanding longitudinal interest development.
