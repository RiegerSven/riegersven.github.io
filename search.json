The tidyverse is a collection of R packages (see Figure 1) that “share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures” and are (specifically) designed for data science (see https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: tidyverse package collection\n\n\n\n\nWithin the tidyverse package collection, the dplyr package (R-dplyr?) provides a set of convenient functions for manipulating data. Together with the pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package (R-magrittr?)), it is an extremely powerful approach to manipulate data in a clear and comprehensible way. The native4 R pipe |&gt; was introduced with R v4.1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the pipe operator |&gt;?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse style guide suggests using the pipe operator “to emphasize a sequence of actions”. The pipe operator can be understood as “take the object and then” pass it to the next function. In the following, the use of the base R pipe operator is shown:\n\n\nTake the data frame exDat and then\n\nSelect the variables: msc1 and msc2 and then\n\nCalculate descriptive statistics using the describe function from the psych package (Revelle 2023) and then\n\nCreate a table with the kable function from the knitr package (Xie 2023)\n\n\n\nexDat |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(c(msc1, msc2)) |&gt;\n  psych::describe(fast=TRUE) |&gt; \n  knitr::kable(digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\nvars\nn\nmean\nsd\nmin\nmax\nrange\nse\n\n\n\nmsc1\n1\n750\n2.52\n0.74\n1\n4\n3\n0.03\n\n\nmsc2\n2\n680\n2.54\n0.72\n1\n4\n3\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, when we use a nested approach the code would look like this:\n\nknitr::kable(psych::describe(exDat,fast=TRUE),digits = 2) \n\n…or maybe a little bit more clear:\n\nknitr::kable(\n  psych::describe(exDat,\n                  fast=TRUE),\n  digits = 2) \n\nNevertheless, when there are many functions, it gets kind of messy and difficult to comprehend. For more information on how to use pipes, see Chapter 4 of the guide.",

    "text": "Besides the functionality of base R (R Core Team 2023), there is the so-called tidyverse (R-tidyverse?) within R. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages (see Figure 1) that “share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures” and are (specifically) designed for data science (see https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: tidyverse package collection\n\n\n\n\nWithin the tidyverse package collection, the dplyr package (R-dplyr?) provides a set of convenient functions for manipulating data. Together with the pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package (R-magrittr?)), it is an extremely powerful approach to manipulate data in a clear and comprehensible way. The native4 R pipe |&gt; was introduced with R v4.1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the pipe operator |&gt;?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse style guide suggests using the pipe operator “to emphasize a sequence of actions”. The pipe operator can be understood as “take the object and then” pass it to the next function. In the following, the use of the base R pipe operator is shown:\n\n\nTake the data frame exDat and then\n\nSelect the variables: msc1 and msc2 and then\n\nCalculate descriptive statistics using the describe function from the psych package (Revelle 2023) and then\n\nCreate a table with the kable function from the knitr package (Xie 2023)\n\n\n\nexDat |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(c(msc1, msc2)) |&gt;\n  psych::describe(fast=TRUE) |&gt; \n  knitr::kable(digits = 2) \n\n\n\n\nvars\nn\nmean\nsd\nmin\nmax\nrange\nse\n\n\n\nmsc1\n1\n750\n2.52\n0.74\n1\n4\n3\n0.03\n\n\nmsc2\n2\n680\n2.54\n0.72\n1\n4\n3\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, when we use a nested approach the code would look like this:\n\nknitr::kable(psych::describe(exDat,fast=TRUE),digits = 2) \n\n…or maybe a little bit more clear:\n\nknitr::kable(\n  psych::describe(exDat,\n                  fast=TRUE),\n  digits = 2) \n\nNevertheless, when there are many functions, it gets kind of messy and difficult to comprehend. For more information on how to use pipes, see Chapter 4 of the guide.",

    "text": "Tip for RMarkdown user\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with RMarkdown (R-rmarkdown?) the FAQ for RMarkdown Users might be interesting for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, what is Pandoc? Pandoc is a universal document converter. It converts files from one markup format into another (e.g., markdown → HTML).\nIn short, with Quarto you can create different types of (reproducible) documents1 including:\n\nHTML\nPDF\nMS Word\nMarkdown\n\nThe focus of this workshop is on HTML (and PDF) documents. For an overview about all formats see here.\n\n\nIt is basically the same2 as working in regular a R-script.\n\nOpen a new file: File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Create your first Quarto document!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a title (& author name)\n\n\n\nSave the document with a reasonable name and use the Render button\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quarto document roughly consists of two parts:\n\nThe YAML header\n\nThe Body\n\n\n\nThe website quarto.org is a great resource to learn it (e.g., follow the guide). It is a daily companion and covers the topics in much greater detail than this page.\n\nThe YAML3 header is enclosed by three dashes (---):\n---\ntitle: \"my-first-quarto-document\"\nformat: html\n---\n\nThe basic syntax of YAML uses so-called key-value pairs in the format key: value. This is extremely powerful, because you can generate great documents like this Quarto book without knowing much about HTML, LATEX or programming in general.\nSome useful key-value pairs:\nsubtitle: \"my subtitle\"\nauthor:\n  - \"John Doe\"\n  - \"Jane Roe\"\n  - \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: today\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: \"Inhaltsverzeichnis\"\nnumber-sections: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Identify useful key-value pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next 5 minutes or so, check out https://quarto.org and identify potential useful key: value pairs. Note: There are different YAML options for the formats:\n\nHTML\nPDF\n\n\nAdd them to your YAML header.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Quarto it is possible to automatically generate citations and bibliographies in many different ways.\nThe key: value pair to include citations in Quarto documents is:\nbibliography: r-refs.bib\nHere we use a so-called BibLaTex (.bib) file. These files can be generated with the most reference management software programs4 (e.g., Citavi, EndNote, zotero, …).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom tip on maintenance of literature management\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is highly recommended to maintain your retrieved citations. This means, whenever you download a single (!) reference by means of the doi (Digital Object Identifier), check whether the reference information is correct. This saves a lot of time in the long run.\n\n\n\nA reference in the .bib-file looks like this:\n@Manual{R-base,\n  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n  author = {{R Core Team}},\n  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n  address = {Vienna, Austria},\n  year = {2022},\n  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Create a .bib file for the R references\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the path with the base::getwd function (should be the same folder as the Quarto document, otherwise you have to provide the path in the YAML bibliography argument).\n\n\ngetwd()\n\n\nSave (some of the) R packages in a character vector.\n\n\npkgList &lt;- c(\"knitr\", # tables\n             \"kableExtra\", # tables\n             \"lavaan\", # generate data\n             \"car\", # recoding\n             \"psych\") # descriptive\n\n\nUse the write_bib function from the kntir package (Xie 2023).\n\n\nknitr::write_bib(x = pkgList,\n                 file = \"r-refs.bib\")\n\n\n\n\nTo change the citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago Manual of Style), we use the csl key5:\ncsl: apa.csl\nThe apa.csl file can be found on github.\nThe citation syntax (How to cite the references in the text?) is briefly explained in the The Body subsection Citation syntax.\n\nThere are many different options to customize the output of the (executed code).The options can be specified:\n\nglobally (see in the following)\nper code block (see the section on Chunk options)\n\nIn the following example, we set echo: false and warning: false.\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\nThis means that no code and no warnings are shown, except you state it otherwise in a specific code block.\nFor more (chunk) options see https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html.\n\nAs explained in the section What is Quarto?:\n\nQuarto is based on Pandoc and uses its variation of markdown as its underlying document syntax (see https://quarto.org)\n\nThis means we can use Markdown syntax6 (together with the information in the YAML header) to generate the different types of documents (e.g., HTML, PDF, …).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Work through the Markdown language section and the three subsections…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText formatting\nHeadings\nLists\n\nThe information is very dense, so do not expect to remember everything.\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of different guides to get a quick overview about the language (see e.g., markdownguide, or Quarto-website).
